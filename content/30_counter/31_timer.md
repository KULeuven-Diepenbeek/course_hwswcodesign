A typical microcontroller has a timer. Although this is a fairly basic component, it has many useful applications. Therefore, adding a timer to your RISC-V microcontroller is the first extension that will be made.

A textbook exercise could be: **Toggle a LED roughly every 500 ms and with each fourth period, toggle all the LEDS**.

## Software

The first way of making a solution for this exercise can be to make it in software.

Simply making loop that increments and resets on 4 will do the trick. The image below shows the output of this program and it indeed shows what was requested.

**BUT** ... what with the timing?

The time during which the LEDS are off is half of the flashing period. In this example the period hence is 2 x **150 ns** = 3e<sup>-7</sup> s. The RISC-V implementation is too quick to meet the timing requirements of the exercise.

#### Introducing wait-like statements

{{% multiHcolumn %}}

The C-code can be altered so there is **wait** statement. Note that the variable *i* is declared as a **volatile** variable. It implies that the value of this variable can be altered by another source. This results in **not** having the compiler optimise this part away.

Through simulatio three different *configurations* can be obtained: (20, 194325), (25, 299025) and (10, 52650).

 There is a polynomial relationship between the three configurations. A bit of algebra can learn you the equation: ```y = 451.5*xÂ² + 622.5*x + 1275```. When targeting a duration of 500'000'000 ns is targeted, **x** can be calculated to be 1052. Given only integers can be used, this would introduce a **small error** [(1051, 499'382'874) and (1052, 500'333'001)].
