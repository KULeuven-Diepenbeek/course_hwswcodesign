Now that the design is taking some size, it is time to start looking at the **cost**. You might have touched upon this earlier in this program. The triangle that is shown here allows you **to pick maximum 2** things to focus on.

* <span style="color: #00BF00; font-weight: bold;">Speed</span> (think clock frequency, throughput, latency)
* <span style="color: #0000BF; font-weight: bold;">Flexibility</span> (think 'only AES' vs 'every cryptographic algorithm ever invented')
* <span style="color: #BF0000; font-weight: bold;">Cost</span> (think euros, mm<sup>2</sup> of Silicon)
