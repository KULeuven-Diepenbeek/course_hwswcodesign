The project within this course will have you designing an HW/SW codesign that encodes sensor data to a QOI encoded image. The resulting design would look something like shown below.

## Goals

This project is to be achieved in two steps: 

1. a software-only version, and 
0. a HW/SW codesign.

This first version (SW-only) will set the reference. Additionally, this will help you in understanding the encoding scheme. The result of the first version will be a working implementation. This will allow you to *run the numbers* (latency, resource usage, throughput, ...).

When the first version is done, optimisations are chosen and you'll set of to make the HW/SW codesign. You can use which ever technique you think is best for obtaining your optimisations.
